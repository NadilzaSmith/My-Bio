        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>I started learning Python as a capstone assignment in college many, many years ago in Brazil. I soon fell in love with the Python and enjoyed completing self taught projects in order to master 
          the language. Many of the projects that I completed were based in data analysis, automation, creating websites, developing games, and apps .</p>

        <h3>Web Development </h3>
        <p> I did a Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp and that include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps.  I find a great interest in many of the design aspects in UI/UX development.  The intangible understanding of the human pysche as well as the technical skills of developing a working site make for a entertaining challenge.

      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <h3>Salvador, Brazil</h3>
      <p class="contato">I grew up in Salvador Bahia, Brazil.  From a young age I was always interested in learning new information, wether that meant through books or online.  This passion for learning lead to an interest in technology, so much so that I even was an IT teacher for multiple classes for up and coming young adults in the technical field.  Throughout schooling I was a devoted student and fully engaged in my studies.  I still study most days to keep current on technology.  I am currently studying to pass multiple certifications in my field of expertise.  This all to say, I am an effective and quick learner with anything I put my mind to.  </p>
